# Supermarket-store-sales-analysis
This notebook analyzes the supermarket store sales dataset which is taken from kaggle.

Here it had below features 

1. Store ID
2. Store Area
3. Items Available
4. Daily Customer Count
5. Store Sales


Here we tried to build a regression model which can predict the store sales by taking the input features like Store Area, Items Available, Daily Customer Count.

# Observations while building the model

a. Applying the algorithm to the dataset does not give good results even after tuning hyperparameters

b. From the heatmap i could observe that the correlation values between independent variables and dependent varaiables is very low , ie near to zero, which would be the reason though why the models are not performing well.
